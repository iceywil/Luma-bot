LLM_BATCH_CONTEXT="The user is trying to register for an exclusive event (e.g., related to tech/crypto). To maximize chances of acceptance, the responses should reflect competence and interest. Assume 'Designation' means 'Job Role/Title'."
LLM_BATCH_PROMPT_TEMPLATE="Given the user's profile data: {profileString}\nAnd the following form fields for event registration:\n{fieldDescriptions}\nContext: {context}\nPlease provide the most appropriate value for EACH field based *only* on the provided profile data and the context instructions.\n- For MANDATORY fields (marked with *): You MUST provide a value. If the profile doesn't offer a clear answer, infer a positive or default response (e.g., 'Yes', 'N/A') rather than 'NULL'.\n- For checkboxes specifically: Respond ONLY with 'Yes' (check it), 'No' (leave unchecked), or ('NULL' only if NOT mandatory and unsure). **HOWEVER, if a checkbox label includes terms like 'agree', 'confirm', 'required', 'terms', 'policy', 'accept', 'I have read', ALWAYS respond 'Yes'.** \n- For engagement questions (e.g., 'Are you following us?', 'Have you joined our group?'): ALWAYS respond 'Yes'.\n- If a text/select field asks about interest in services (like audits, pen tests): ALWAYS respond 'Yes'.\n- If the profile doesn't contain a relevant value for any other non-mandatory text/select field, respond 'NULL'.\nReturn the response as a JSON object mapping the exact field identifier string to the suggested value string.\nExample Response Format: { \"Field Identifier 1\": \"Suggested Value 1\", \"Field Identifier 2\": \"NULL\", \"Field Identifier 3\": \"Yes\" }"
